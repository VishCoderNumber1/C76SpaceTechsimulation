            When you see this photo, you might wonder how it is taken.
            That is the concept of spacecraft.
            Every spacecraft needs some energy to propell itself beyond our natural world, in search of other planets, that it will photograph.
            The data is sent to scientists, who study it, and sometimes the photos may be put on the internet for even common people to see and enjoy.
            But throughout the time a spacecraft is first launched, outside of its original home, there is a lot that is happening.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;Before a spacecraft is first pushed, it needs to appear on Earth's surface.
            In order for that, a bunch of masterminds and engineers are needed to work together.
            Once a spacecraft is made, it needs a rocket.
            The rocket is the propeller for the spacecraft, launching it into space.
            A rocket needs some specific fuel to do so.
